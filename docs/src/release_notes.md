# Release Notes

Release notes contain _noteworthy_ changes between **minor** (`1.x`) releases.

> These aren't strictly pinned to **tags**.
> So a feature announced as `1.n` might already be present in a previous or added in a later **patch** (`1.x.x`) release.
>
> See [releases](https://github.com/carapace-sh/carapace-bin/releases) for an exact changelog.
