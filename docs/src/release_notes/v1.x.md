## Cmd

Experimental support for [Cmd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe) through [Clink](https://chrisant996.github.io/clink/).

```lua
# ~/AppData/Local/clink/carapace.lua
load(io.popen('carapace _carapace cmd-clink'):read("*a"))()
```

> Lots of fundamental features not yet working (multipart, quotes, ..).
> Weirdly flags don't work for `git` at the moment (they do for other commands though).


## Fish

With [4.0b1](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/releases/tag/4.0b1) onwards the following workaround is not needed anymore:
```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completions
carapace --list | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -I{} touch ~/.config/fish/completions/{}.fish # disable auto-loaded completions (#185)
```
