# v1.1 - Nightly Bats

![](./v1.1/banner.png)

Nightly batch release straight from master.

## GoReleaser

Updated [goreleaser] config to adopt defaults across all projects.

> This changes the release artifact names slightly and might break some scripts.

## Nightly

Added [carapace-sh/nightly].

> Nightly builds use the same [goreleaser] config, but in a different environment.

## Selfupdate

With `carapace --selfupdate` specific [nightly]/[stable] releases can be installed.

![](./v1.1/selfupdate.cast)

Executable is installed to the [GOBIN] directory, essentially shadowing any system installation.


```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"
#            │                │            └system installation (e.g. /usr/bin/carapace)
#            │                └selfupdate/go based installation ($GOBIN)
#            └user binaries
```

### Requirements

- [curl] for downloads
- [PATH] containing the [GOBIN] directory
