# v0.29 - Art Exchange

![](./v0.29/banner.png)

One step further to exchange completions between commands.

## carapace.sh

Registered the domain [carapace.sh](https://carapace.sh).

## Specs

The [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) is now hosted at [https://carapace.sh/schemas/command.json](https://carapace.sh/schemas/command.json).
The local generation was removed and the spec header needs to be changed to:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://carapace.sh/schemas/command.json
````

## Root Command

Restructured the `carapace` root command which was (and still is) a bit of a mess.
Some "flags" (subcommands) were renamed/changed for consistency.

- `--list=json` -> `--list --format json`
- `--macros` -> `--macro`
- `--scrape [spec]` -> `--codegen [spec]`

## Macro

`$_` prefix in specs is now deprecated and needs to be replaced with `$carapace.`

```sh
$carapace.color.HexColors
# invokes `carapace _carapace macro color.HexColors ""`

$carapace-spec.Spec(example.yaml)
# invokes `carapace-spec _carapace macro "Spec(example.yaml)" ""`
```

> You can replace this with the `--in-place` flag directly:
> ```sh
> sed 's/$_/$carapace./g' ~/.config/carapace/specs/*.yaml
> ```
